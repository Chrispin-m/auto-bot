A python program that loads URLs from an excel file, loads each one, takes a screenshot and saves the screenshot locally. The python program then loads another excel file with general user content, and creates a pdf for each user (each pdf is unique in that each pdf has a unique firstname and a unique screenshot image of the URL that was loaded)
